What are you doing? Do you get the PH.D? Or you dead, or doing nothing but deep in failure?

Come on! Tell me you have a good life.

Enough of money, a super computer (over 1PFlops?), good at English, Docter's degree, a lot of friends who love you, the soul mate ... or could you speak Japanese? Have you been Tokyo and CMU?

Don't give up your dream, I'm stupid, please be stupid in your whole life.

Have you invented the true AI machine? Solute the NP problem? Create the best algorithm in Machine Learning? Tell me you did one of them.

May you be a stupid good happy person everlasting.
