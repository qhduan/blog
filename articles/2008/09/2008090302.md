 What do I want to be? 

 

 When I was a child,I wanted to be an astronomer.Because I thought looking at the star every day is an interesting thing.But when I grown up,I don't want to be an astronomer.Why?Because I know that the astronomer is always a mathematician and a physical scientist and I don't like to be like that.Then,I wanted to be a computer programmer.I like the codes,it looks like that it can make anything what I want to make.But now,I want to a professor of mathematics and computer science.In the end,I know the pure computer science is mathematics and maybe the base of the world is mathematics.I don't know how can I be it.I think I should study hard and never give up.
