Yesterday, I heared this course 'Crafting an Effective Writer: Tools of the Trade' from a administrator of a QQ group.

I have finished the first unit of this course now, it

s really a very interesting course. The most interesting part is I learn English grammar from other Chinese guys, but this time, I could learn grammar from American guys. Infact, it's kind of funny.

I think I got the increasement of my English skill over last year, through MOOC courses. I even cannot imagine this, some course I could read it without subtitle, or very less subtitle, that's awesome!
